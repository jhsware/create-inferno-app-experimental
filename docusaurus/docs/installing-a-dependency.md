title: Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes Inferno and InfernoDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create Inferno App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, Inferno Router) with `npm`:

```sh
npm install --save inferno-router-dom
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add inferno-router-dom
```

This works for any library, not only `inferno-router-dom`.
