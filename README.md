# Create Inferno  App

** work in progress **

Current state: You can start the sample app using `npm run start` and reloading the page updates the app.

This is how you test the project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jhsware/create-inferno-app-experimental.git
$ cd create-inferno-app-experimental
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

The application code is in `packages/cia-template/template/src` and available commands are:

```
$ npm run start
$ npm run build
```

## DEV NOTES:

TODO: Test features (help wanted, suggested solutions would be nice)
- hot reloading - maintains state
- hot restart - updates code but returns to initial state
- build for production
- build for server-side rendering (development/production)
- eject
- source-maps working in browser
- source-maps working for server-side debugging
- using typescript

### Issues with `npm run start`
TODO: `npm run start` rebuilds on changes but does not update in browser
  - The file updates in devtools but change isn't reflected in DOM (try changing a text in the page)
  - Possible side effect of "index.esm.js:4 You are running production build of Inferno in development mode. Use dev:module entry point."
  - Possibly related to https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app/issues/15 (PR https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app/pull/17/files)

TODO: `npm run start` uses Inferno in production build, should use development build
- index.esm.js:4 You are running production build of Inferno in development mode. Use dev:module entry point.
